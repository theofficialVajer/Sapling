    <h1>Our Services</h1>
    <h3>Secretarial</h3>
    <p>We provide essential administrative support to the accounting team by organizing financial records, managing communication related to accounts, handling basic financial documentation and data entry into accounting systems. This ensures the smooth daily operations of the finance function, allowing accountants to focus on analysis and reporting.</p>
    <h3>Book Keeping</h3>
    <p>Bookkeeping is the systematic and daily recording of a company's financial transactions, including income, expenses, purchases, and sales. Often using double-entry, it aims to create accurate and current financial records that are essential for accounting and generating financial reports</p>
    <h3>Compilation</h3>
    <p>Compilation is the process of organizing and presenting recorded financial data into a structured format, often including basic financial statements like the Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet. This makes the raw data understandable and useful for business owners and regulatory compliance.</p>
    <h3>Tax</h3>
    <p>In Singapore, tax is a mandatory contribution to the government to fund public services. Individuals pay income tax on their earnings, with rates increasing as income rises, and typically file their returns around mid-April. Companies pay corporate income tax on their profits. Additionally, a Goods and Services Tax (GST) is applied to most goods and services. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is the government body responsible for managing taxes.</p>
    <h3>GST</h3>
    <p>In Singapore, GST (Goods and Services Tax) is a consumption tax applied to most goods and services, currently at 9%. Consumers pay it, but GST-registered businesses collect it, charging output tax on sales and claiming back input tax on purchases, remitting the difference to IRAS. Businesses with over S$1 million turnover must register. Exports are zero-rated, while some supplies like residential property sales are exempt.</p>
    <h3>Passes and Permits</h3>
    <p>Payroll is the process of paying employees, involving calculating gross pay and handling mandatory deductions like CPF (social security contributions from both employer and employee), SDL (for skills development), and income tax (deducted under PAYE and remitted to IRAS). Net pay is the amount after deductions, typically paid via bank transfer. Employers must keep detailed records and comply with Singapore's Employment Act.</p>
